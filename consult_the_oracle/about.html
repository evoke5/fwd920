                                <p>A spiritual awakening is emerging in the world today. Many are seeking other forms of spiritual guidance, returning to the old ways to find a sense of purpose in their lives. Consult the Oracle is a tool for the open-minded soul to connect to these rites of the old ways, which rely on intuition and an awareness of the mystery of the natural world. By uncovering the hidden truths in our subconscious selves, we can unfold our healing and growing process.</p>

                                <p>People have always tried to bring certainty to their lives by trying to foresee what awaits them just around the corner. Throughout the ages, the divinatory arts have found countless channels for the manifestation of intuition as detailed observation, from ancient oracles enunciated in temples, to the reading of glyphs, and even the flight patterns of birds.</p>
                                
                                <p>The archetypal nature of the symbols found in the Oracle strikes hidden, unconscious chords and reflects hitherto unknown knowledge or insight in relation to the observer’s situation, thus revealing things which could not possibly, in any rational way, be discoverable. This is why “clairvoyant” or “psychic” powers are not a prerequisite for interpreters of the Oracle, but rather, an awareness of the archetypal patterns or currents at work in life. These archetypal patterns in human life are often portrayed through pictures and stories, and are reflected by the symbols herein. We meet these experiences again and again on different levels at different times in life.</p>
                                
                                <p>Like many forms of divination, Consult the Oracle can help you tap into your own intuition and the wisdom of the universal energy that guides your life. Let us now turn to the Oracle itself, to better understand the grand archetypal design at work in our lives, and find out what the future holds.</p>
